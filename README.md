# Nighty Scripts Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing my custom **Nighty** scripts—extensions designed to enhance the Nighty self‑bot for Discord.

## 🔧 What is Nighty?

Nighty is a powerful and fully-featured Discord self‑bot launched in 2020. It acts as an advanced enhancement tool for your personal Discord account, providing:

- Slash‑command autocompletion and enhanced UI interactions :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Advanced automation tools (backup/restore, server cloning, logging, giveaways, Nitro lottery claiming, etc.) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Custom script engine allowing you to write Python scripts to extend functionality :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Local-first data privacy, running as if it's a native Discord client :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

To get started, download and install Nighty from the official site for Windows 10/11 and Server 2022 :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
